0,S-Class,GLS 450 4MATIC SUV,"In an ever-more-crowded field of luxury SUVs, treat yourself to some room. The sleek, spacious GLS wraps class-leading innovations in bold yet elegant style. With a long wheelbase for more legroom and a smoother ride, the GLS lets you live large without the bulky driving experience. It's chiseled and muscular, yet polished and agile. 100% LED lighting adds to its brilliance. Widescreen displays and perhaps the industry's most advanced visual, voice and touch interfaces help the GLS feel quickly like second nature. Exquisite craftsmanship envelops you in timeless luxury. From 64 colours of ambient lighting to heated seats and armrests in the first two rows, the GLS lets everyone in on the Star treatment. Available luxuries include four ventilated and massaging seats, and 5-zone climate control. GLS wheels start at a sizable 21 inches and only go up from there, all the way to 23 inches. The GLS 580's standard AMG styling is available in the GLS 450 Sport Package. Both offer a Night Package with gloss black styling elements. The GLS offers truly luxurious seating for seven adults, standard. A 6-seater layout with power 2nd-row captain's chairs is also available. The Premium Rear Seating Package can make the rear cabin of the GLS 580 even more accommodating. Using Artificial Intelligence, MBUX can turn your words into your GLS's action. Just say 'Hey, Mercedes, it's cold in here' or 'I need a coffee,' and MBUX can warm the cabin or set the standard MB Navigation. It can even learn your habits, and new phrases. Available new ENERGIZING Comfort networks front-seat heating, ventilation and massage with ambient light and sound, to help rejuvenate your body and spirit as you drive. Ionizer-purified air can be subtly infused with fragrance. It's a sensation for every sense. A big 3,500kg towing capacity is just one of the GLS's superhuman abilities. Available tech lets it spot a traffic jam and help you negotiate it with ease. Change lanes with the tap of a turn signal. Or help protect your ears in a crash. Mercedes me connect puts a world of remote features, from starting to locking its doors to scheduling service, in a handy smartphone app. And standard augmented video can overlay your next navigation instruction on a live view of the turn itself. GLS capability has many dimensions, but they all aim to outmeasure any other large luxury SUV. Rigid standards create a flexible vehicle that's spacious yet agile. At home on a trail, with a trailer, or coddling you in its fine tailoring. Born to be an SUV, not bred from a pickup truck, the GLS independent air suspension helps the roomy third row offer first-rate comfort. The standard power second row, available to seat three or two, also helps make 3rd-row access easy. The GLS 580 Premium Rear Seating Package treats 2nd-row passengers to exclusive luxuries from headrest pillows to ventilation and a massage. The large center armrest features a wireless tablet to control a variety of rear-cabin comfort features. Both the 362-hp GLS 450 turbo inline-6 and the GLS 580's 483-hp biturbo V8 offer advanced tech and abundant torque. Now with EQ Boost electrification, their Integrated Starter-Generator can also add 21 hp, or allow gas-free coasting and lower emissions. With nine speeds, the advanced 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission offers a versatile range of ratios, for quick response and efficient, quiet cruising. Fingertip shift paddles and the modes of DYNAMIC SELECT let you take charge anytime. With standard multimode, height-adjusting AIRMATIC suspension and fully variable 4MATIC all-wheel drive, the GLS puts its best foot forward even as seasons and surfaces challenge it. Available E-ACTIVE BODY CONTROL can camera-scan the road ahead, lean into curves, and even rock the GLS 580 out of a sand trap.",101900,2021,0,Black,"designo Black DINAMICA roof liner, 2nd-row Captain's Chairs, Wood/leather steering wheel","Lavishly soft Black DINAMICA covers the ceiling, a luxurious complement to the exquisitely tailored cabin of the GLS.

1,A-Class,GLA 250 4MATIC SUV,"More than a commanding view of the road ahead, the GLA offers a rewarding view of what's next. It not only puts more sport in compact SUVs, it puts more you. Within its nimble length, the GLA gives you more space to ride, more room to shop, stow and be spontaneous. A wide tailgate and 40/20/40 rear seats welcome your gear. A pair of 7-inch screens help keep you informed, entertained and in command. One's for gauges, one's a touchscreen. Available 10.25-inch versions let you visualize, and customize, even more. A spectrum of finishes is just the start of GLA style. The Sport Package adds sporty pedals, seats and steering wheel. Available 64-colour ambient lighting lets you choose the hues that suit your mood. Show how you roll on 18, 19 or 20-inch wheels.

From a tight corner of the city, to a tight corner of a back road, the GLA is agile and easy to maneuver. Turbo power and a solid stance make it quick on its feet, confident in your hands. Agility starts with a 4-wheel independent suspension. Each wheel tackles bumps on its own for composed comfort, but they're all in for crisp handling. The GLA 250's advanced engine delivers 221 turbo horses from a compact 2.0 litres. Its 258 lb-ft of torque is at your command over a wide range of rpm, for quick response anytime. The dual-clutch 8-speed is a quicker, smoother automatic, or a paddle-shifted manual on demand. With DYNAMIC SELECT, one console control calls up a range of performance profiles. Light, nimble variable-torque 4MATIC can send power from front wheels to rear based on each tire's real-time grip. A suite of available engineering features heightens off-road capability.

In an old mill in 1967, two automotive engineers with a passion for motorsports began turning Mercedes-Benz sedans into winning racecars. Today, as the performance division of Mercedes-Benz, AMG continues to create victory on the track and desire on the streets of the world. Every Mercedes-AMG vehicle is the product of craftsmen, designers and engineers who live to test limits, and for a singular goal: Driving Performance. A Mercedes-AMG engine starts with the state of the art. Everything from fuel pressure to exhaust routing is developed to quicken, heighten and intensify its response, and yours. From patented processes to cut friction to a new generation of electrified performance, AMG technology is fueled by its racing success. Two 2.0L twin-scroll turbo engines let you have your AMG GLA in two strengths: mighty or almighty. The 302-hp GLA 35 can sprint to 100 in 4.9 seconds. A handcrafted 382-hp engine, the most powerful 4-cylinder in production, catapults the GLA 45 to 100 in just 4.4 seconds.

Available 64-colour LED ambient lighting includes multi-hue motifs, and soothing themes that cycle through colours. Supportive seats are appointed in a spectrum of upholstery options. Trim options include two natural-grain woods. Aluminum dash and door accents evoke the grab bars of the iconic G-Class. Crisp, upright lines maximize cabin space and minimize overhangs. Beyond standard 18-inch wheels, four 19-inch options include AMG designs in the Sport Package and black-accented Night Package. It can take you new places, or make old favorite roads feel fresh. It can take up to six of your friends, or make easy work of the weekend chores. And wherever you take it, it'll outperform to make every drive memorable. Compact outside, the GLB cabin goes big: 40/20/40-split 2nd-row seatbacks recline or fold flat. EASY-ENTRY widens your way to the available 50/50-split 3rd-row seat. With all rear seats down, there's room for two of you and 1,755 litres of gear. The advanced, efficient 2.0L inline-4 engine's twin-scroll turbo pumps up power to 221 hp. All 258 lb-ft of torque is on tap from just 1,800 rpm, for quicker takeoffs, passing, merging and climbing. The clever dual-clutch 8-speed can be an easygoing automatic or paddle-shifted fun.

Climate Comfort seats are a luxury you'll soon consider a necessity. Three levels of heating and cooling ventilation are offered. By gently circulating air through perforations in the seat and backrest, ventilated seats help keep you cooler and your clothes drier during warmer months.

On cold or damp days, using both the ventilation and heating together can circulate the seat heating more quickly, to help keep you warm and dry. Available 3rd-row seating provides room for two additional passengers to ride in the GLB. Suitable for average-sized adults but ideal for children, the seatbacks can be folded down in a 50/50 split to enhance the versatility of the cargo area.
