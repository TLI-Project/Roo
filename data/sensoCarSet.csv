There«s no need to wait for the engine to warm up the standard defroster in the climate control system. Specially developed brakes cut weight and offer excellent braking performance on the track. Bronze-painted calipers feature 'AMG Carbon Ceramic' logos. Harder, longer-wearing carbon-fiber-reinforced ceramic front discs endure extreme heat and loads, for even shorter stopping distances and higher fade-resistance in high-performance driving. The two-piece discs, 402 mm front and 360 mm rear, offer higher total braking force, yet are substantially lighter overall to enhance suspension and steering response. Racing-derived carbon fibre accents the engine compartment cover, a fitting tribute to the car's motorsports soul and precision craftsmanship. A camera in the windshield can record activity occurring in front of the vehicle, and let you save it for playback using your own compatible USB flash drive. Potentially useful for documenting an accident or other event, the 1,280x720-pixel video with a 30-Hz frame rate can also include vehicle speed and the time of day. Playback can be viewed on the car's multimedia display or on your own computer via your USB flash drive.",new,0.89,0.85,0.78,0.71,0.67,0.6,0.58,0.51,0.42,0.57,"https://nafta.starconnect-ce.i.daimler.com/iris/iris.jpg?COSY-EU-100-1713d0VXqbEFqtyO67PobzIr3eWsrrCsdRRzwQZUkRZbMw3SGtlKUtsd2HTcUfp8cXGEuiRJ0l3ItOB2NQnbApjdpI5uVfzQC3qXFkzNRLdm7jZ7ohKVFHt%25vqCtTyLRzLyYax758rH1KnOn8wsOfoiZUioM4FGSMTg90h26PDBSbSeWAtRtsd6spcUfSONXGEvaXJ0lLHqOB2aScbApenyI5us5xQC3Uh1kzNG%259m7j0yvhKVBbQ%25vqAIqyLR5QHYaxCrJrH1zgdn8w7PyoiZKeNM4F1IJTg9wQn6PDGPsSeW0h%25tXSMNV3OWyLRALVYaxBNDrH1LHun8waAfoiZHqZM4FNZmTg9Pgk6PDe7sSeWsa9tsdUo3cUfGMWXGE0JjJ0lBOfOBi1aftkV3xb1ig8K212rbpldCCNZkFu6pFIT9ZxexrlrKE847dvE5jCsAs4iZUa8Fm&&fb=1&BKGND=12&IMGT=A27&POV=be040%2Cpzm&crop=70,100,1850,1000&width=1440&height=600"

There«s no need to wait for the engine to warm up the standard defroster in the climate control system. Specially developed brakes cut weight and offer excellent braking performance on the track. Bronze-painted calipers feature 'AMG Carbon Ceramic' logos. Harder, longer-wearing carbon-fiber-reinforced ceramic front discs endure extreme heat and loads, for even shorter stopping distances and higher fade-resistance in high-performance driving. The two-piece discs, 402 mm front and 360 mm rear, offer higher total braking force, yet are substantially lighter overall to enhance suspension and steering response. Racing-derived carbon fibre accents the engine compartment cover, a fitting tribute to the car's motorsports soul and precision craftsmanship. A camera in the windshield can record activity occurring in front of the vehicle, and let you save it for playback using your own compatible USB flash drive. Potentially useful for documenting an accident or other event, the 1,280x720-pixel video with a 30-Hz frame rate can also include vehicle speed and the time of day. Playback can be viewed on the car's multimedia display or on your own computer via your USB flash drive.",used,0.93,0.91,0.88,0.83,0.79,0.76,0.72,0.67,0.64,0.6,"https://nafta.starconnect-ce.i.daimler.com/iris/iris.jpg?COSY-EU-100-1713d0VXqbEFqtyO67PobzIr3eWsrrCsdRRzwQZUZpZbMw3SGtlKUtsd2HTcUfp8cXGEuiRJ0l3ItOB2NQnbApjdpI5uVfzQC3qXFkzNRLdm7jZ7ohKVFHt%25vqCtTyLRzLyYax758rH1KnOn8wsOfoiZUioM4FGSMTg90h26PDBSbSeWAtRtsd6spcUfSONXGEvaXJ0lLHqOB2aScbApenyI5us5xQC3Uh1kzNG%259m7j0yvhKVBbQ%25vqAIqyLR5QHYaxCrJrH1zgdn8w7PyoiZKeNM4F1IJTg9wQn6PDGPsSeW0h%25tXSMNV3OWyLRALVYaxBNDrH1LHun8waAfoiZHqZM4FNZmTg9Pgk6PDe7sSeWsa9tsdUo3cUfGMWXGE0JjJ0lBOfOBi1aftkV3xb1ig8K212rbpldCCNZkFu6pFIT9ZxexrlrKE847dvE5jCsAs4iZUa8Fm&&fb=1&BKGND=12&IMGT=A27&POV=be040%2Cpzm&crop=70,100,1850,1000&width=1440&height=600"
